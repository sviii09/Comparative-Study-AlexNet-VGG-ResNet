What is VGG?  
VGG (Visual Geometry Group) is a convolutional neural network architecture proposed by Karen Simonyan and Andrew Zisserman from the University of Oxford in 2014\.

Conv(3x3) → ReLU → Conv(3x3) → ReLU → MaxPool(2x2)- Formulae

How CNN’s constitute to the project ?

### **Foundational Architecture**

**AlexNet**, **VGG**, and **ResNet**—are **types of CNNs**.

* CNNs are specifically designed for **image data**.

* They **automatically extract features** like edges, textures, patterns, and objects from raw images.

| Model | No. of Layers | Training Time | Accuracy (say approximate) |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| **Model** | **No . of Layers** | **Training time** |  |
| AlexNet | 8 | Fast | Medium (\~80%) |
| VGG16 | 16 | Slower | Higher (\~85%) |
| ResNet50 | 50+ | Efficient due to residuals | Best (\~90%)  |
